# Masked-Aware-Fusion-Attention-for-Muti-feature-Missing-Data-Imputaion
This repository presents a hybrid architecture combining a learnable Temporal Decay-Gap Mechanism and Mask-Aware Fusion attention for muti-feature missing data imputaion.

# Datasets
Thwo datasets were used (i) PEMS-BAY and (iii) METR-LA. The PEMS datset is uploaded in the data folder. Download PEMS-BAY.csv and METR-LA.csv from https://zenodo.org/records/5146275

# Usage
To train and evaluate the model, from the terminal run 
```bash 
python3 main.py
```
